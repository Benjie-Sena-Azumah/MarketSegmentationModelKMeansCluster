# OVERVIEW 
This dataset was analyzed using K-Means Clustering, the goal was to identify natural groupings (clusters) among customers based on their Satisfaction and Loyalty scores.

### Objective

- Used K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on Satisfaction and Loyalty scores.
- Identify patterns in customer behavior.

### Data Preprocessing

- Check for missing values → No missing values found.
- Scale the data (if needed) → K-Means works better with normalized data.
- Handle outliers → No significant outliers were found.

 ### Interpretation of Clusters

- Low Satisfaction, Low Loyalty (Unhappy customers)
- High Satisfaction, High Loyalty (Loyal customers)
- Medium Satisfaction, Varying Loyalty (Mixed behavior)
- Visualize clusters using a scatter plot with distinct colors.
